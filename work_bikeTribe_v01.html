               Jane
               33 years old
               She rides a bicycle to commute to her job and sometimes on the week end for a trip.
               She wants to take care herself by associating functional and healthy transport.
               In the same time she saves money on common transport card.
               she works in a big shipping worldwide company.

            <p class="workExplanationFullLength"><span class="boldItalic">Client/ Designer goals</span></br>
            What are my goals? On wich aspect (political, social, financal or functional) my app should emphasize?
            </br>
            </br>
            Politic aspect: 20%
            Financal aspect: 25%
            Functional aspect: 20%
            Social aspect: 35%
            </br>
            </br>
            With a higher focus on the social aspect, the application is more likely to attract a larger user base,
            leading to increased community engagement and potential revenue generation.
            This, in turn, enables more efficient development of new features and provides greater weight to the application's political goals
            related to reducing greenhouse gas emissions.
            I believe than a balanced approach that highlights the social aspect while maintaining functionality can lead to a successful and sustainable app.
